# Scripts

Just a bunch of scripts for my personal use 
--------------------------------------------

 - weather : return few informations about current weather based on your IP location (using ipinfo.io and openweathermap.org)

 - wallabag : used to export saved articles through wallabag api (maybe later to import on wallabag too). If you don't know wallabag, discover that amazing tool https://wallabag.org/en .
